 This is the secoend version(2.1) of my first C project in my entire life. On previous, I didn't get any version number cuz I didn't think even that I'll do this more dynamic or more featureful. I'll try to add more features here and every feature adding version will (2.0 3.0 4.0) like this and optimizing or bug or error fixing update will (2.1 2.2 2.3 5.5) like this.


This is a sample or simple terminal based command line application where you can store some integers and then-
    - You can insert or replace via Insert fucntion
    - You can edit a value in specific index number via Edit function
    - You can delet a value or number from specific index number with Delet function
    and so on
